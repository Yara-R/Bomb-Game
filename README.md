In order to have fun, we created a challenge to defuse a bomb. Through the interaction of arduino with python, you have only 60 seconds to decipher a 4-digit password and identify which of the 3 wires (Red, Yellow and Black) you need to energize, and if you choose the wrong wire or the time runs out, the buzzer will beep non-stop!
